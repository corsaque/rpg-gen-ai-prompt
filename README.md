prompt to generate rpg scenario suitable for kids and teens

Here is the story of this prompt :) Have fun :)

We were in the mountains for a vacation. I had just made coffee when my daughter (11) and her 14-year-old cousin looked at me and said:

“Can you run a pirate RPG for us… now?”. Their question was calm, but it was a demand.



I looked around. No dice, no rulebooks, no clever ideas hiding in my back pocket. Just me, my coffee, and two kids who clearly had their afternoon planned.



"Give me five minutes," I said, pulling out my phone. I opened an chatgpt, perplexity and claude on my phone and asked for a short pirate adventure for teens - no too scary stuff or gore, a bit of wonder, close to the movies they like. What came back wasn’t a full script, but a good outline I could use: a three-part story, a stylish rival captain, a few clear scenes, and a na quick maps of the locations.



The girls did what good players do: they took the story in their own direction. They tried to befriend the “villain.” They decided there had to be a haunted lighthouse somewhere in those mountains (there wasn’t… until there was). I kept up. The phone sat next to me and when I needed it, it gave me a name, a clue, a flag signal. Most of the time I didn’t need it. Knowing it was there made me braver.



Once we finished a session I realised this feels a lot like a good workshop at work. You arrive with a simple plan and limited time, and people bring the energy. Your job is to hold the thread, keep it interesting, and say yes when someone has a better idea, even if it wasn’t on your slide. The tool helps you stay present when the room surprises you - which is when the best things happen.



The girls still talk about the compass that could call a storm and the sea-sprite with a bell for a voice. I keep thinking about our next team session at work: start with a small structure, let people make bold choices, and give the story some air. The phone can just sit there like a quiet helper, ready for the moments when we get stuck.



If you read until this moment here is a bonus for You - a prompt I used in the comments.
